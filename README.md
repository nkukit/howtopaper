# Some rules to follow when writing a paper

Welcome! It seems you are writing a paper with my supervision. Congratulations! (Although, we will see if you think it was worth congratulating you on that decision at the end).

However, be sure to follow the following rules as it makes my life a whole lot easier!

## General Writing and Flow

- A scientific paper doesn't mean it takes rocket science to read it. Make it as easy as oossible for the reader. Use short sentences, refrain from complicated sentence constructs (like you would do in German).
- Make sure you have a clear flow through your paper in general, but also each chapter in specific.
- Refrain from using too many iterations like "First....Second....Third". It's okay to do this a few times, but it is lazy writing.

## Terminology

- Always call the same things with the same term. E.g, if your central contribution is an <em>artifact</em>, always call it "artifact" (not software tool, not model, not anything else). Decide on what term fits your idea best and then stick to it.
- Use abbreviations consistently. If you introduced "machine learning (ML)", then it is always called "ML" from that point on. However, this does not apply to Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion, where no abbreviations should be used.

## References

- Try to use references only if you are either writing a statement which needs proof (nothing trivial) or you are naming examples. Try to use one core reference only for a statement, which is not too controversial. Only use multiple references when making examples or stating something controversial / provocative.
- Use page references only if you are directly citing
- Talking about references: Try to prefer sources from the same community / the top journals within this community. If you are submitting to a top journal, make sure to prefer sources from this very journal. Try to avoid self-referencing...at least until your manuscript gets accepted ;-)

## Grammar

- The dash ('â€”') ('---' in LaTeX) has no spaces before or after.
- Do not use " for quotes in LaTeX, but `` and ''
