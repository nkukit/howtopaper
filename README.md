# Some rules to follow when writing a paper
with Niklas

Welcome! It seems you are writing a paper. Congratulations! 

However, be sure to follow the following rules as it makes my life a whole lot easier!

## Terminology

- Always call the same things with the same term. E.g, if your central contribution is an <em>artifact</em>, always call it "artifact" (not software tool, not model, not anything else). Decide on what term fits your idea best and then stick to it.
- Use abbreviations consistently. If you introduced "machine learning (ML)", then it is always called "ML" from that point on. However, this does not apply to Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion, where no abbreviations should be used.

## References

- Try to use references only if you are either writing a statement which needs proof (nothing trivial) or you are naming examples. Try to use one core reference only for a statement, which is not too controversial. Only use multiple references when making examples or stating something controversial / provocative.
- Use page references only if you are directly citing
- Talking about references: Try to prefer sources from the same community / the top journals within this community. If you are submitting to a top journal, make sure to prefer sources from this very journal. Try to avoid self-referencing...at least until your manuscript gets accepted ;-)

## Grammar

- The dash ('â€”') ('---' in LaTeX) has no spaces before or after.
- Do not use " for quotes in LaTeX, but `` and ''
