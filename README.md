# Some rules to follow when writing a paper

## Terminology

- Always call the same things with the same term. E.g, if your central contribution is an <em>artifact</em>, always call it "artifact" (not software tool, not model, not anything else). Decide on what term fits your idea best and then stick to it.
- Use abbreviations consistently. If you introduced "machine learning (ML)", then it is always called "ML" from that point on. However, this does not apply to Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion, where no abbreviations should be used.
